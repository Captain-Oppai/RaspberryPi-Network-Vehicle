# RaspberryPi Network Vehicle
 This repository is dedicated to my project that will allow the commanding of a raspberry pi vehicle.

 This project is one of my first python programs and it's by no means good, it's more or less an experiment and shouldn't be criticized too hard.
 Hopefully, the project will lay the framework for my Raspberry Pi network swarm project.
 
 I will post as much information as I can for this project for any other people wanting to replicate it or replicate it with their own modifications. I might make an attempt at commenting but I will provide no promises.
 
 I may use some pieces that are laser cut or 3D printed, I will provide the files used but as I'm not a designer it's probably better to just remake things.
 
 If you'd like to discuss anything you can contact me via discord (Jisatsu#1987)

 As a motor controller, I am currently looking at the L298N. Any links to purchased modules will be updated here!

 In the way of motors, I haven't found a specific one to purchase nor what kind of power I would need behind it.
 
 I'm using a Raspberry Pi 3 for development as of now however, I will be changing to Raspberry Pi Zero with wifi/bluetooth connectivity(hopefully)
