# RaspberryPi Network Vehicle
 This repository is dedicated to my project that will allow the commanding of a raspberrypi vehicle.

 This project is one of my first python programs and it's by no means good, it's more or less a experiment and shouldn't be critized too hard.
 Hopefully the project will lay the framework for my Raspberry Pi network swarm project.
 
 I will post as much information as I can for this project for any other people wanting to replicate it or replicate it with their own modifications. I might make a attempt at commenting but I will provide no promises.
 
 I may use some pieces that are laser cut or 3D printed, I will provide the files used but as I'm not a designer so it's probably better to just remake things.
 
 If you'd like to discuss anything you can contact me via discord (Jisatsu#1987)
